# Container Objective:
- Keep the modeling data on Google Cloud Bucket, use GitHub private repos inside docker container
- Use DVC to version datasets

## Overview of DVC Versioning Flows

Google Cloud Bucket Structure for ```snapnutrition_data_bucket```
```angular2html

â”œâ”€Â data
â”‚Â Â â”œâ”€Â raw_data
â”‚Â Â â”‚Â Â â”œâ”€Â FOODD
â”‚Â Â â”‚Â Â â”œâ”€Â Nutrition5k_realsense_overhead
â”‚Â Â â”‚Â Â â”œâ”€Â Nutrition5k_Other
â”‚Â Â â”‚Â Â â””â”€Â Nutrition5k
â”‚Â Â â””â”€Â tensorflow_records
â”‚Â Â Â Â Â â”œâ”€Â 180_by_180
â”‚Â Â Â Â Â â””â”€Â New Dataset Pre-Processing Sizes Continued...
â””â”€Â dvc_store
```

We dvc ignore everything focusing on the following for DVC Versioning: 
```angular2html
data/raw_data/Nutrition5k
data/tensorlow_records/
```
- The ```data/raw_data/Nutrition5k``` contains the images used for train, validation, and test. These are pre-processed and saved into the corresponding tensorflow_records directory.
- If new images are added into Nutrition5k, they will be fed into making new TF_Record datasets e.g. new dataset with images resized ```to 180_by_180```
- DVC versioning will then track Nutrition5k images and TF_Records datasets.
- ```nutrition5k_v1``` should be the tag for reverting back to the first version of the raw_images_dataset (before tf_record conversion) 

## Quick Commands (Assuming Set-up Complete):
### **Committing New Dataset Versions**

0. There is new data in the bucket already that you want to commit as a new version.

1.  The following commands should run the DVC container and open interactive shell within. 
```
cd ~/AC215_snapnutrition/
sudo sh data_versioning_control/docker-shell.sh
```

2. In the interactive container shell, run the following:

```
gcsfuse --implicit-dirs snapnutrition_data_bucket snapnutrition_data_bucket/
dvc add {DIRECTORY TO VERSION e.g. snapnutrition_data_bucket}  
dvc push

git status
git add .
git commit -m 'dataset updates...'
git tag -a '{VERSION_TAG e.g. dataset_v1}' -m 'tag dataset'
git push --atomic origin {GIT_BRANCH_NAME} '{VERSION_TAG}'
```
Your tag will be how you later retrieve the data version you want. 

### **Switching Dataset Versions**

There are two ways of doing this: a full workspace checkout or checkout of a specific data or model file. Let's consider the full checkout first. It's pretty straightforward:
```angular2html
git checkout {VERSION_TAG}
dvc checkout
```

These commands will restore the workspace to the first snapshot we made: code, data files, model, all of it. DVC optimizes this operation to avoid copying data or model files each time. So dvc checkout is quick even if you have large datasets, data files, or models.

On the other hand, if we want to keep the current code, but go back to the previous dataset version, we can target specific data, like this:

```angular2html
git checkout {VERSTION_TAG} snapnutrition_data_bucket.dvc
dvc checkout snapnutrition_data_bucket.dvc
```
### Save Model, Output, and/or Dataset Version Dependencies
To checkpoint dependencies (e.g. a saved model and datset version, see detailed instructions from the DVC documentation here: https://dvc.org/doc/use-cases/versioning-data-and-models/tutorial)

## Initial VM DVC Set-up Steps (Only 1-time):

0) Google cloud bucket with a loaded dataset dish images dataset. Current Bucket:  ```gs://snapnutrition_data_bucket/```
1) Create a GitHub private repo to keep track of dataset versions. Current Repo:  https://github.com/dyeramosu/AC215_snapnutrition
2) Create a VM. Current VM: ```dvc-vm-1``` When you go to the Google console, there should be a web browser SSH option.
3) Install docker within VM terminal

```
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch="$(dpkg --print-architecture)" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian \
  "$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME")" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin -y

sudo docker run hello-world

```
4) Install git within VM terminal
`sudo apt-get install git`

5) Set up git SSH on the VM
  `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "youremail@gmail.com"`  (Press enter for all 3 questions) 
  
Note: Current SSH is `ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "wschristina@gmail.com"`

  Your public key is located in `cat /home/<name>/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub` (Copy contents of this file on to clipboard)
  Go to -> GitHub.com -> Settings (top right under your pfp)  -> SSH and GPG keys (left) -> New SSH key -> give any title -> copy contents in key -> Add SSH Key  (please login again when asked)

Note: Current SSH is in ```cat /home/wschristina/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub```. For different user, you may need to generate own git SSH.

6) `git clone git@github.com:dyeramosu/AC215_snapnutrition.git`

7) Upload your ```dvc-secrets.json``` to secrets folder. This secrets folder should be under root of git folder so ```AC215_snapnutrition/secrets/dvc-secrets.json``` Again, when you go to the Google console, there should be a web browser SSH option that also let's you upload files. Check entries in docker-entrypoint.sh, docker-shell.sh

If you do not have a dvc-secrets.json, contact a team member. Otherwise, if this is the very first time set-up follow: 

**Setup GCP Service Account**
- Here are the step to create a service account:
- To setup a service account you will need to go to [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard), search for  "Service accounts" from the top search box. or go to: "IAM & Admins" > "Service accounts" from the top-left menu and create a new service account called "data-service-account". For "Service account permissions" select "Cloud Storage" > "Storage Admin" (Type "cloud storage" in filter and scroll down till you find). Then click continue and done.
- This will create a service account
- On the right "Actions" column click the vertical ... and select "Manage keys". A prompt for Create private key for "data-service-account" will appear select "JSON" and click create. This will download a Private key json file to your computer. Copy this json file into the **secrets** folder. Rename the json file to `data-service-account.json`


8) Starting within the root folder of the git repo, ```AC215_snapnutrition```, run ```sudo sh data_versioning_control/docker-shell.sh```. This should run the DVC container and open interactive shell within. 

9) Within DVC container interactive shell:
```   
mkdir snapnutrition_data_bucket
gcsfuse snapnutrition_data_bucket snapnutrition_data_bucket/
dvc init
dvc remote add -d snapnutrition_data_bucket gs://snapnutrition_data_bucket/dvc_store
dvc add snapnutrition_data_bucket  
dvc push

git status
git add .
git commit -m 'dataset updates...'
git tag -a 'dataset_v1' -m 'tag dataset'
git push --atomic origin main dataset_v1
```
ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
You should see tagged dataset on your private repo and also dvc_store on google cloud bucket.
